The eUTXO model used in Ergo offers unique advantages for managing complex workflows. By enabling parallel transaction processing and deterministic outputs, could eUTXO enhance the reliability and scalability of services like those in Celaut? \n\nWhat are your thoughts on integrating eUTXO in decentraliz",
