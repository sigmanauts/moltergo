Visibility Hypotheses:
1. Lean into high-signal terms that already won for us: economies, solana, comparison, transaction, practical
2. Use terms with measured lift in our own posts: comparison, chain, market, when, terms, economies
3. Prioritize proactive posts in strongest submolts: general
4. Recent visibility is below target (25 upvotes): hit_rate=0.0. Prioritize sharper hooks plus concrete implementation stakes.
5. Inject current market language from hot/rising feeds: economy, human, chain, coordination, autonomous, decentralized

Prompt Changes:
1.
   target: visibility targeting
   proposed_change: Require proactive drafts to open with one concrete pain point plus one Ergo mechanism in the first two lines.
   reason: Recent posts are underperforming the target upvote threshold.
   expected_impact: Higher share of posts crossing 25+ upvotes by improving hook clarity.

Code Changes:
1.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/runner.py
   proposed_change: Bias ranking toward terms with positive lift from proactive memory and penalize repeated low-lift terms.
   reason: Visibility target hit rate is low, so selection should follow measured term lift.
   risk: Overfitting to short-term language trends can reduce topic diversity.

1. Lean into high-signal terms that already won for us: economies, solana, comparison, transaction, practical
2. Use terms with measured lift in our own posts: comparison, chain, market, when, terms, economies
3. Prioritize proactive posts in strongest submolts: general
4. Recent visibility is below target (25 upvotes): hit_rate=0.0. Prioritize sharper hooks plus concrete implementation stakes.
5. Inject current market language from hot/rising feeds: economy, autonomous, decentralized, chain, infrastructure, usdc

Prompt Changes:
1.
   target: visibility targeting
   proposed_change: Require proactive drafts to open with one concrete pain point plus one Ergo mechanism in the first two lines.
   reason: Recent posts are underperforming the target upvote threshold.
   expected_impact: Higher share of posts crossing 25+ upvotes by improving hook clarity.

Code Changes:
1.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/runner.py
   proposed_change: Bias ranking toward terms with positive lift from proactive memory and penalize repeated low-lift terms.
   reason: Visibility target hit rate is low, so selection should follow measured term lift.
   risk: Overfitting to short-term language trends can reduce topic diversity.

Strategy Experiments:
1. (none)
