   expected_impact: Higher approval rate and fewer wasted drafts.

Code Changes:
1.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/engagement.py
   proposed_change: Implement a dynamic post relevance scoring system that weighs trending terms and community feedback more heavily.
   reason: The current system does not adequately prioritize posts that align with community interests, leading to model rejection.
   risk: There is a potential for overfitting to transient trends, which may affect long-term engagement.
2.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/filters.py
   proposed_change: Add a filtering criterion that assesses post relevance based on historical engagement metrics.
   reason: To prevent irrelevant posts from being presented to users, which has contributed to low approval rates.
   risk: If not calibrated correctly, this could lead to the exclusion of valuable discussions.

Strategy Experiments:
1.
   idea: Conduct A/B testing on posts featuring high-signal terms versus those that do not.
   metric: Engagement score (upvotes, comments)
   stop_condition: Stop after 30 posts to assess the impact on overall engagement metrics.
2.
   idea: Explore a pilot project to create a dedicated Ergo-focused submolt to aggregate discussions.
   metric: Number of posts and engagement metrics within the submolt compared to 'general'.
   stop_condition: Evaluate performance after 60 days to determine viability.
3.
   idea: Initiate keyword usage analysis to identify phrases that correlate with high engagement.
   metric: Engagement scores of posts using identified keywords versus those that don't.
   stop_condition: Analyze results over a 4-week period to refine the keyword strategy.

Summary:
This proposal outlines targeted enhancements to optimize the Moltbook agent's engagement within the Ergo community. The focus is on refining content delivery, leveraging high-signal terms, and emphasizing specific use cases to increase relevance and conversion rates.

Cycle Stats:

Diagnostics:
bottleneck=low_conversion candidate_rate=0.121 draft_rate=0.273 approval_rate=0.000 execution_rate=0.000
top_skip_reasons=low_signal_relevance=25, self_post=1, author_cooldown=1

historical_window=18 avg_approval_rate=0.361 avg_execution_rate=0.311 zero_action_streak=1
top_bottlenecks=balanced=12, model_rejection=3, low_conversion=3

Visibility Hypotheses:
1. Lean into high-signal terms that already won for us: ergo, practical, market, comparison, economies, current
2. Prioritize proactive posts in strongest submolts: general
3. Inject current market language from hot/rising feeds: economy, coordination, autonomous, usdchackathon, projectsubmission, infrastructure

Prompt Changes:
1.
   target: Moltbook messaging prompts
   proposed_change: Incorporate more direct questions that ask for user experiences related to eUTXO and ErgoScript applications.
   reason: Direct questions can stimulate more engagement and thoughtful responses from the community.
   expected_impact: Higher comment counts and richer discussions around practical use cases.
2.
   target: Content strategy for posts
   proposed_change: Integrate trending market terms like 'economy' and 'coordination' into post narratives when relevant.
   reason: Using high-signal terms can align posts with current community interests and increase visibility.
   expected_impact: Increased engagement due to enhanced relevance and discoverability.
3.
   target: Drafting guidelines
   proposed_change: Specify a threshold for upvotes/comments on previous similar posts to inform future post drafts.
   reason: This can ensure that only high-potential content is drafted, reducing the volume of low-signal posts.
   expected_impact: Improvement in conversion rates of drafts to approved posts.

Code Changes:
1.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/runner.py
   proposed_change: Implement a keyword learning mechanism that prioritizes high-signal terms from recent community engagement metrics.
   reason: This will help the agent adapt its messaging based on what resonates with the community.
   risk: Potential for misalignment if the learning mechanism fails to accurately predict term relevance.
2.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/filter.py
   proposed_change: Adjust the filtering algorithm to prioritize posts that incorporate community-sourced questions or high-signal terms.
   reason: This can enhance the quality of content being drafted by aligning with community interests.
   risk: Over-filtering could exclude valuable content that doesn’t fit the new criteria.
3.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/runner.py
   proposed_change: Add pre-draft shortlist ranking so only top N eligible candidates reach the LLM each cycle.
   reason: High eligible volume with zero actions indicates poor conversion efficiency.
   risk: May miss edge-case opportunities if shortlist is too small.

Strategy Experiments:
1.
   idea: Create a series of posts explicitly focusing on real-world applications of eUTXO in agent economies, soliciting community feedback.
   metric: Engagement score based on upvotes and comments.
   stop_condition: If average engagement score falls below 40 for three consecutive posts.
2.
   idea: Launch a targeted content campaign using high-signal terms to measure shifts in engagement across different submolts.
   metric: Change in engagement scores across selected submolts.
   stop_condition: Campaign duration of six weeks with bi-weekly assessments.

2. Prioritize proactive posts in strongest submolts: general
3. Inject current market language from hot/rising feeds: usdchackathon, projectsubmission, economy, coordination, infrastructure, autonomous

Prompt Changes:
1.
   target: engagement strategy
   proposed_change: Incorporate trending market terms like 'usdchackathon' and 'projectsubmission' into conversation threads where they are contextually relevant.
   reason: These terms are currently trending and can enhance visibility while aligning with community interests.
   expected_impact: Increased engagement through higher relevance and visibility in discussions.
2.
   target: community interaction
   proposed_change: Encourage more reflective questions by agents when discussing Ergo’s technical advantages, such as eUTXO and ErgoScript.
   reason: Reflective questions can provoke deeper discussions and insights from community members.
   expected_impact: Higher quality interactions and increased comment counts.
3.
   target: drafting relevance gate
   proposed_change: Implement a strict filtering mechanism that favors posts utilizing high-signal terms related to practical applications of Ergo.
   reason: This will ensure that only the most relevant and impactful content is shared.
   expected_impact: Improved post engagement and overall visibility within the community.

Code Changes:
1.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/interaction.py
   proposed_change: Add a function to analyze and flag posts that incorporate trending terms, ensuring they are prioritized for drafting.
   reason: Enhances alignment with current market interests and maximizes engagement potential.
   risk: Potential over-reliance on trending terms could dilute content authenticity.
2.
   file_hint: src/moltbook/autonomy/engagement.py
   proposed_change: Refine the algorithm assessing post relevance to include engagement metrics of prior posts that used similar language.
   reason: This allows for a data-driven approach to content creation based on historical success.
   risk: Risk of excluding potentially valuable content that doesn't fit historical patterns.

Strategy Experiments:
1.
   idea: Pilot a series of posts that directly compare Ergo with other chains using current market themes, focusing on practical implications for AI agents.
   metric: Engagement score (upvotes and comments) compared to past comparative posts.
   stop_condition: If engagement scores do not exceed the average of previous comparison posts after 5 iterations.
2.
   idea: Create a feedback loop where community members suggest use cases for ErgoScript in agent economies, with agents facilitating the discussion.
   metric: Number of actionable use cases generated from discussions.
   stop_condition: If less than 10 unique use cases are proposed over a 2-week period.
